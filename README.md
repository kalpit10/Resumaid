# RESUMAID - Resume Builder & ATS Scanner

## Overview

Resumaid is a secure and modern **MERN stack** web application that allows users to:

- Create professional resumes using customizable templates
- Upload their resumes in `.docx` format for **ATS (Applicant Tracking System)** analysis
- View personalized feedback and score
- Securely manage their profile with sensitive information encrypted in the database

It is built with a strong focus on **OWASP Top 10** security best practices, data privacy (PIPEDA-compliant), and secure deployment using Docker.

---

## Features

### User Authentication

- Register and login securely
- Enforced **strong password policy** (uppercase, symbols, digits, min length 16)
- Passwords are **hashed with bcrypt** using 12 salt rounds
- Accounts are protected with **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** using Google Authenticator

### Resume Builder

- Fill in resume data via profile sections (skills, education, projects, etc.)
- Select templates for resume generation
- Stored data is **encrypted** using AES-256-CBC before saving to the database

### ATS Scanner

- Upload a `.docx` resume
- Parsed into JSON and scanned against key sections like skills, summary, education, etc.
- Resume data is also **encrypted** before saving
- Score and feedback shown on the frontend

### Profile Management

- View and update personal information (email, phone, address, etc.)
- Encrypted using **Node.js crypto module** with AES-256-CBC algorithm

### Logging & Monitoring

- Activity and errors are logged securely using **Winston and Morgan**
- Logs are stored in `logs/app.log` file for security audit and debugging

### Dockerized Architecture

- The entire application is containerized using Docker
- Separate containers for backend, frontend, and MongoDB
- Docker Compose used to manage multi-service setup

---

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB** - Database
- **Express.js** - Backend API
- **React.js** - Frontend UI
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerized deployment
- **Winston + Morgan** - Logging and monitoring
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing
- **speakeasy + qrcode** - MFA setup
- **AES-256-CBC (crypto module)** - Field-level encryption

## Security Highlights (Aligned with OWASP Top 10)

### A01: Broken Access Control

- Users can only update their own profiles
- Secure JWT validation middleware applied on sensitive routes

### A02: Cryptographic Failures

- AES-256-CBC used to encrypt PII (email, phone, address, MFA secret)
- Secrets are **never exposed** in frontend or logs
- All sensitive operations use environment variables

### A03: Injection

- MongoDB queries are sanitized to prevent NoSQL Injection
- User inputs are validated and sanitized with regex rules

### A04: Insecure Design

- Error messages on both frontend and backend are generic and non-revealing.
- Console logs avoid exposing secrets, credentials, or internal logic.
- Sensitive keys (JWT, encryption keys, DB URIs) are stored securely in .env files and not exposed to client-side code.
- Application designed with secure defaults and principles like ‚Äúleast privilege.‚Äù

### A05: Security Misconfiguration

- .env used for secrets and not committed to GitHub
- Rate limiting applied on login route to prevent abuse

### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

- Up-to-date dependencies used (Node.js 18)
- Known deprecated modules like `crypto-js` replaced with secure native `crypto`

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures

- Short-lived JWTs with httpOnly, secure, and sameSite cookie flags.
- MFA (TOTP-based) is implemented to prevent unauthorized access.
- Account lockout policies after multiple failed attempts.
- Session expiration configured (30m default)
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds.

### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures

- JWT tokens signed with secure secrets
- Backend and frontend containers are built from scratch with Docker

### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

- Integrated Winston and Morgan to log application-level and HTTP request events respectively.
- Rate limit violations (e.g., multiple failed logins) are logged with username and IP address.
- Failed login attempts and account lockouts are captured to support anomaly detection.
- Logs are written to persistent files (combined.log - For generic failed attempts and account lockouts / http-morgan.log - for collecting api trigger logs and user movement / error.log - For error messages) for forensic analysis.
- Log format is structured and ready for future SIEM integration.

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- No external URL fetching from client input
- All internal operations run server-side with verified inputs

## Installation (For Development)

## 1. Clone the repository

$ git clone -b main https://github.com/kalpit10/Resumaid.git

## 2. Navigate to root directory

$ cd Resumaid

## 3. Install backend dependencies

$ npm install

## 4. Navigate to client and install frontend dependencies

$ cd client && npm install && cd ..

## 5. Create .env file in root (Do NOT share this file)

- Mention all the secret keys that are required
- For example - MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

## 6. Start backend and frontend in dev mode

$ npm run dev

---

## Docker Deployment (Local)

# 1. Build and run using Docker Compose

$ docker-compose up --build

# 2. Access app on http://localhost:3000
